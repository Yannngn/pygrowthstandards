# Child growth standards

This web site presents growth reference data for children and adolescents, 5-19 years (or 61-228 months).

The WHO Reference 2007 is a reconstruction of the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO reference. It uses the original NCHS data set supplemented with data from the WHO child growth standards sample for under-fives. To develop this reference the same statistical methodology was used as in the construction of the WHO standards.

This reference complements the WHO child growth standards for 0-60 months published in April 2006.

1. Height-for-age

2. Weight-for-age

3. Body mass inder-for-age (BMI-for-age)

# Obs:

There is a mistake on the naming of Weight-for-age data `hfa-boys-perc-who2007-exp_07eb5053-9a09-4910-aa6b-c7fb28012ce6.xlsx`, it should be name as wfa

# Interpretation of cut-offs (BMI)

- **Overweight:** $> +1\,\mathrm{SD}$ (equivalent to BMI $25\,\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ at 19 years)
- **Obesity:** $> +2\,\mathrm{SD}$ (equivalent to BMI $30\,\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ at 19 years)
- **Thinness:** $< -2\,\mathrm{SD}$
- **Severe thinness:** $< -3\,\mathrm{SD}$
